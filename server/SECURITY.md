# Security Documentation - iBridge AI

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the iBridge AI application and provides guidelines for secure deployment and maintenance.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, RM, and Employee roles with appropriate permissions
- **Password Strength Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Removes malicious scripts, iframes, and JavaScript injections
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Pattern matching to detect and block SQL injection attempts
- **HTML Entity Escaping**: All user input is properly escaped
- **Input Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **API Rate Limiting**: 500 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Sensitive Operations**: 1000 requests per hour per IP
- **Custom Key Generation**: Combines IP and User-Agent for better tracking

### 4. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 5. Data Protection
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for password storage
- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**: Passwords never included in API responses
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored securely
- **Database Connection Security**: Encrypted connections to MongoDB

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- **Security Event Logging**: Failed authentication attempts, suspicious activities
- **Request Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant requests
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak system information

## Production Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set strong JWT secret keys
- [ ] Configure secure database connections
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for production loads

### SSL/TLS Configuration
1. **Obtain SSL Certificate**: From a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.)
2. **Certificate Installation**: Place certificates in `/certificates` directory
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure SSL paths in production environment
4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Enable HTTPS redirection in production
5. **HSTS Headers**: Configure HTTP Strict Transport Security

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certificates
ENFORCE_HTTPS=true
```

### Database Security
- Use MongoDB Atlas with authentication
- Enable encryption in transit and at rest
- Configure IP whitelisting
- Regular security updates
- Proper backup and recovery procedures

### Server Security
- Keep OS and software updated
- Configure firewall (only allow necessary ports)
- Use non-root user for application
- Regular security audits
- Implement proper backup procedures

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit --audit-level high

# Run tests with security focus
npm test -- --grep "security"
```

### Manual Security Testing
1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test rate limiting on login endpoints
   - Verify JWT token expiration
   - Test password strength requirements

2. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test XSS prevention
   - Test SQL injection prevention
   - Test input sanitization

3. **Authorization Testing**
   - Test role-based access control
   - Verify endpoint permissions
   - Test token validation

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track suspicious IP addresses
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for security events

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to secure state
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

### Common Security Incidents
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Mitigated by rate limiting
- **Data Breaches**: Prevented by input validation and encryption
- **DDoS Attacks**: Mitigated by rate limiting and proper infrastructure
- **Unauthorized Access**: Prevented by authentication and authorization

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling
- Regular security code reviews
- Keep dependencies updated

### Deployment

- User consent mechanisms
- Right to data deletion
- Data portability

### Industry Standards
- OWASP security guidelines
- ISO 27001 compliance
- SOC 2 requirements
- PCI DSS (if handling payments)
